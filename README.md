<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.
The dataset will be in the form [image â†’ captions]. The dataset consists of input images and their corresponding output captions.



### Built With

* Flask
* ResNet
* LSTM
* CNN
